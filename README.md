dotfiles
=============

These are my dotfiles.
`setup.bash` is checked with [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

Bootstrap
--------------

    $ ./setup.bash bootstrap

Run this for only the first time to bootstrap this dotfile environment.

Reload Configurations
----------------------

    $ ./setup.bash

Without `bootstrap`, it just reloads configurations, which is actually creating symbolic links again.
