        Emacs vs Vim?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I don't have a strong opinion on it. I can use both.
        When I use emacs, I prefer using <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> to default emacs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spacemacs = Vim Style Command + Emacs Ecosystem. For general purposes except coding, I would use Vim.
        (I have a dedicated repo for my vim configuration. <a href="https://github.com/junkpiano/vim">junkpiano/vim</a>)

    <p>
        On Unix system, especially for cursor navigation, key-binding is closer to Emacs. but for text editting, vim is
        better.

    <h2>What is your favorite text editor?</h2>
    <p>
        VSCode and Xcode.
        I am an iOS developer on day time, but sometimes write code for webside, backend system, and automation.
        Vim and Emacs isn't my primary option any longer, but I can come back to them anytime.
